# Flower-Classification-using-CNN
This project demonstrates Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on a flowers dataset containing multiple categories (e.g., Daisy, Rose, Tulip, etc.) and can classify flower images into their respective classes.
